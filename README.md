*The above model list is built into the extension. For other models, please refer to [Custom Models](#custom-models).*

> See each provider's website for API key registration and billing details.

## Quick Start

1. Install the extension.
2. Open the **Language Models** panel, select a provider, and enter your API key — this is the native VS Code approach and the recommended way.
3. Open Copilot Chat, click the model selector, and choose a model.

> **Alternative:** Use the command **Copilot Adapter: Add API Key** (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`) to store a key without opening the Language Models panel.

A step-by-step walkthrough covers all of the above: open it via `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` **Welcome: Open Walkthrough** *AI Models Adapter for Copilot Chat*.

For a visual guide with screenshots, see [How to Add a Model Provider](docs/add-model.md).

## Security

API keys are stored exclusively in [VS Code's Secret Storage](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#SecretStorage), backed by the OS credential manager — Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows, libsecret on Linux.

- **Never written to `settings.json`** — keys are stored as secrets, completely separate from VS Code settings. They cannot be synced via Settings Sync and will never appear in any configuration file on disk.
- **Cannot be accidentally committed** — because keys exist only in the OS credential store, there is no file to stage or push.
- **Zero runtime dependencies** — the extension has no third-party library or external service dependencies at runtime. All networking uses VS Code's built-in HTTP facilities.

## Features

### Thinking Modes

Reasoning models expose a configurable thinking level accessible in the model's settings inside the Language Models panel:

| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| **None** | No reasoning steps — fastest output |
| **High** | Balanced depth, good for day-to-day tasks |
| **Max** | Full reasoning budget for hard problems |

*Levels shown are DeepSeek V4 as an example; option names may differ across providers.*

### Vision Proxy

Text-only models cannot accept image attachments directly. When a vision proxy is configured, the extension automatically describes any attached images using a separate vision-capable model and injects those descriptions as text — so text-only models can handle image attachments seamlessly.

Set up via **Copilot Adapter: Set Vision Proxy Model** or the `copilot-adapter.visionProxyModel` setting.  
Disable at any time by setting the value to `off`.

### Prefix Cache Hit Rate

The extension reorders messages in a conversation so that cacheable content appears first, boosting the cache-hit rate for models with prefix caching or automatic caching (DeepSeek, Qwen, Zhipu).  When debug mode is `info` or above, the output channel logs per-request cache details:

```
model: deepseek-v4-pro, tokens: prompt=18576 reasoning=40 completion=57, cache: hit=12160 miss=6516 rate=65%
```

### Context Window

The extension reports token usage to VS Code for every request, using one of two strategies:

- **API-reported usage** (DeepSeek, Qwen, Zhipu, Moonshot) — the model returns exact `prompt_tokens` and `completion_tokens` in the streaming response.  This is the primary path and requires no estimation.

- **Fallback estimation** (MiniMax and other providers that don't return streaming usage) — when the API does not include usage data, the extension estimates tokens from the character count of the request and response text.  The log will indicate fallback mode:

  ```
  Using fallback usage estimation (API returned no usage data) — prompt chars: 15234, response chars: 487
  ```

#### Dynamic Ratio Calibration

The chars-to-token ratio used by `provideTokenCount` (VS Code's context-window calculation) starts at a default of **4.0** and is automatically calibrated from real API usage data over time.  Each request that returns exact usage updates the ratio using EMA smoothing (80% old, 20% new).  Only changes ≥ 10% are persisted to avoid noise:

```
Chars-per-token ratio calibrated for deepseek: 4.00 to 3.38 (based on API usage: 63200 chars / 18703 tokens)
```

Providers without exact usage data (e.g. MiniMax) keep the static default ratio.

### Custom Models

VS Code Copilot Chat's official **Custom Endpoint** only supports basic model configuration (name, endpoint, API key) — it lacks vision proxy, customizable thinking modes, and cache hit rate logging. Copilot Adapter's **Custom Models** fills these gaps:

- **Vision Proxy** — text-only models can accept images via an automatic vision-proxy pipeline.
- **Customizable Thinking Modes** — configure per-model reasoning effort with vendor-specific request body shapes (DeepSeek, Qwen, Anthropic, etc.), all selectable from the model picker.
- **Cache Hit Rate Logging** — monitor prefix-cache efficiency (hit/miss rates per request) in the output channel.

Bring any OpenAI-compatible model into Copilot Chat by defining its metadata (name, endpoint, capabilities, token limits) directly in the configuration file.  Thinking models (`"thinking": true`) get automatic reasoning-effort configuration based on the model ID, with full customization available when needed.

For a step-by-step guide with screenshots, see [How to Add a Custom Model](docs/add-custom-model.md).  Ready-to-copy templates for DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Qwen, Zhipu, MiniMax, Gemini, Grok and more are available in [`custom-models-template.jsonc`](docs/custom-models-template.jsonc).

### Balance & usage display

For API-key based providers (DeepSeek, Moonshot), the extension can display your account balance on each model's information card. For Coding Plan providers (Kimi Code), the extension displays plan usage quotas (rate-limit window, weekly usage and total quota). The result appears at the bottom of the model hover card in the Language Models panel.

The query result is cached to avoid excessive API calls. You can control the cache duration via the `copilot-adapter.balanceCacheTime` setting. Changing it to `Off (no cache)` fetches the balance on every model list refresh.

[Balance and Usage Information](docs/balance-usage-info.md)

### Price display

The extension uses VS Code's unit-price API. Some models are configured with pricing, and the extension shows the unit price (e.g. per 1K tokens or per 1M tokens) on the model hover card, and computes the available credits from the current balance or usage. Currency priority for the displayed price is:

1. Currency returned in the balance API response
2. Currency specified in the endpoint configuration
3. Currency from the `copilot-adapter.pricingCurrency` setting
4. VS Code UI language (Chinese → CNY, others → USD)

*Note:* for `DeepSeek` models, the default price shown on the hover card is the official off-peak pricing, while the long-context price represents the official peak pricing (this is because VS Code's unit-price API only distinguishes `default` and `longContext`).

|---|---|---|
| `copilot-adapter.maxTokens` | `0` | Max output tokens per request; `0` uses the model's built-in default |
| `copilot-adapter.visionProxyModel` | `"off"` | Model to use as vision proxy, or `"off"` to disable — see [Vision Proxy](#vision-proxy) |
| `copilot-adapter.visionProxyPrompt` | *(system prompt)* | Custom system prompt for the vision proxy model |
| `copilot-adapter.requestTimeout` | `180` | HTTP request timeout in seconds; `0` = no timeout |
| `copilot-adapter.requestRetries` | `2` | Auto-retry count on rate-limit (429) or server errors (503), max 5 |
| `copilot-adapter.imageTokenEstimate` | `1020` | Estimated tokens per image for context-window tracking |
| `copilot-adapter.tokenRatio` | `4.0` | Default chars-per-token ratio for token estimation |
| `copilot-adapter.tokenRatioGlobal` | `false` | Force all models to use the global ratio, ignoring per-model calibration |
| `copilot-adapter.tokenRatioAutoCalibrate` | `true` | Auto-tune ratio from actual API usage data over time |
| `copilot-adapter.tokenRatioCalibrationThreshold` | `0.1` | Minimum relative change (1–100%) to persist auto-calibrated ratio |
| `copilot-adapter.toolWarmup` | `false` | Send fake `activate_*` tool calls before real requests (improves tool stability on some models) |
| `copilot-adapter.balanceCacheTime` | `60` | Cache duration (seconds) for balance/usage queries. `0` disables caching — see [Balance & usage display](#balance--usage-display) |
| `copilot-adapter.pricingCurrency` | `""` | Fallback currency for credits unit on model hover cards. Priority: balance API > endpoint > this setting > VS Code language (zh → CNY, else USD) |

| `copilot-adapter.debugMode` | `"off"` | Log verbosity: `off` / `info` / `meta` / `verbose` |

### Request Timeout

Some models' thinking modes can produce very large outputs (for example, lengthy reasoning chains before the final answer). If you see timeout errors in the output channel, try increasing `copilot-adapter.requestTimeout` to give these requests more time to complete.

### Debug Mode Levels

| Level | Output channel | Model `id` / `apiId` / endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| `off` | — | — |
| `info` | Yes (request metadata) | — |
| `meta` | Yes (request metadata) | Yes |
| `verbose` | Yes (request metadata) | Yes |

## Notes

**Profile isolation:** If you use VS Code [Profiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles), the official Copilot Chat configuration is isolated per profile — and Copilot Adapter's configuration follows the same rule.  API keys, model groups, and custom model definitions are all scoped to the active profile.
